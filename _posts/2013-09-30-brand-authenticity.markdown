After spending the majority of my career helping brands differentiate themselves with marketing strategies based on features and benefits, I find myself wanting to uncover brand authenticity first and foremost, seeking core values that can be understood through the lens of corporate social responsibility and supported by measurable results.

For this article's purpose, I'm defining sustainability as organizational longevity. It is in every organization's best interest to embrace sustainable practices—aka CSR—to maintain growth. With a deep understanding of a organization's DNA, and a clearly articulated vision as to why they exist in the world, marketers and content creators are able to support growth through the management of all the experiences a brand stands for in ways that flow naturally and dynamically throughout a customer's experience.

###Less is more
An obvious benefit to the most traditional of the triple bottom lines (i.e. financial, social, and environmental) is the cost savings associated with the sustainable practice of using less. This effort alone can foster a culture of innovation, and with marketing, can stretch to customer and employee engagement programs. It also presents an opportunity to differentiate your brand—small effort, big upside.

###What are my core values?
It's a hard question to answer as an individual, even more difficult as an entity with a board of directors, an executive staff, and stakeholders. Joseph Campbell, famous American mythologist, writer and lecturer, believed that artists are a culture's myth-makers. That may be true in "art" where a false belief or idea can be reinterpreted, but the science of branding won't tolerate mythology. 

I believe today's brand stewards have the more difficult task of crafting stories of legend. Brand creatives' consider a problem or need, conceptualize approaches, and craft solutions into the simplest, most impactful human expressions—be it a product, a communication, or an experience.

Designers seek to authentically and truthfully connect to the human condition. And with the wired world as your audience, and with social channels to critique your every move, what you produce, publish or present has to be believable and authentic.

###A daunting task-not.
It's natural that we align ourselves and gravitate toward entities that share common values and experiences. This is where the opportunity for progress exists, for like-minded organizations, experience-makers, and audiences to collaboratively create something bigger and more transformative than either party could produce alone.

The problem is that most efforts at CSR may go unnoticed due to the pace of business or the lack of internal communications infrastructure that would identify them as an organizational value.

The journey is the reward
It takes courage to uncover and reveal what is true, and even more courage to broadcast your truths to the public. The inevitable misstep is certain, how we recover is the measure of our growth, progress and authenticity.
